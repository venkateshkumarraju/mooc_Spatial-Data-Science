# Spatial Data Science

Data visualization helps you digest information by using symbols to visually represent quantities and categories. You can quickly make comparisons and perceive relative proportions, patterns, relationships, and trends. Data visualization is important throughout the analysis process, from exploring your data, to interpreting your results, to communicating your findings. Various data visualization techniques are available in ArcGIS. In this exercise, you will use these techniques to explore your data and look for any interesting relationships that may be useful in a predictive analysis

# Scenario
Because voting is voluntary in the United States, the level of voter participation (referred to as "voter turnout") has a significant impact on the election results and resulting public policy.

Modeling voter turnout, and understanding where low turnout is prevalent, can inform outreach efforts to increase voter participation. In this exercise, you will use various visualization techniques to explore relationships and patterns of voter turnout and to identify potential variables to use in your predictive analysis.
