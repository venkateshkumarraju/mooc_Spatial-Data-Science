# Spatial Data Science
## visualization 
Data visualization helps you digest information by using symbols to visually represent quantities and categories. quickly make comparisons and perceive relative proportions, patterns, relationships, and trends. Data visualization is important throughout the analysis process, from exploring your data, to interpreting results, to communicating findings. Various data visualization techniques are available in ArcGIS.
Scenario
Because voting is voluntary in the United States, the level of voter participation (referred to as "voter turnout") has a significant impact on the election results and resulting public policy.

Modeling voter turnout, and understanding where low turnout is prevalent, can inform outreach efforts to increase voter participation. In this exercise, various visualization techniques to explore relationships and patterns of voter turnout and to identify potential variables to use in your predictive analysis.

## prediction 
Prediction is an important part of spatial data science. You can use prediction to forecast future values (for example, predicting tomorrow's air quality for a specified location), downscale information (for example, using voter turnout data at the county level to predict voter turnout at the census tract level), or fill in missing values in a dataset.

Scenario

Create models that predict voter turnout. These models will use explanatory variables, such as income and age, to predict the dependent variable, which is voter turnout.

## Suitability modeling 
Goal: Choose a location for a corporate headquarters that has a minimal carbon footprint. This location should be situated and designed in a way that is attractive to prospective employees.

Based on the goal for this suitability model, and a discussion with corporate leaders and subject-matter experts (SMEs), the criteria were identified. These criteria have been organized into four objectives to clarify how the criteria relate to each other.

Building site: A location that reduces construction cost and is easily accessible by employees
Energy independence: An optimal location to incorporate renewable energy devices
Access to amenities: A location that is accessible to various amenities
Environmental concerns: A location that will minimally disrupt critical environmental areas and corridors

## Detect patterns

Statistical cluster analysis can help you minimize the subjectivity in your maps by identifying meaningful clusters in your data. The Hot Spot Analysis and Outlier Analysis tools use statistics to detect spatial patterns in your data

## Data patterns using space-time pattern mining

Space-time pattern mining tools use statistics to incorporate the spatial and temporal aspects of your data to help you understand its spatiotemporal trends.

## Object Detection

### Scenario
Tax assessors at local government agencies often rely on surveys to estimate property value and calculate property taxes. These surveys are infrequent, which means that there can be some inaccuracy in the assessment records. Swimming pools are an important part of these assessments because they impact the value of a property.

using  ArcGIS deep learning tools to detect all swimming pools in a defined area.

## Story Maps

The pattern detection analysis examined Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation rates in the contiguous United States for 2019.  From completed a hot spot analysis and outlier analysis to find meaningful patterns of high and low SNAP participation. The space-time pattern mining analysis examined SNAP participation from 2010 to 2019, examining how SNAP participation rates changed over time
