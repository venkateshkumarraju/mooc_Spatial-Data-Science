# Spatial Data Science
## visualization 
Data visualization is crucial for understanding information by using symbols to visually represent quantities and categories. It allows for quick comparisons and helps in perceiving relative proportions, patterns, relationships, and trends. Visualization is essential throughout the analysis process, from exploring data to interpreting results and communicating findings. ArcGIS offers various data visualization techniques.

Scenario: In the United States, voter turnout significantly impacts election results and public policy due to voluntary voting. Modeling voter turnout and identifying areas with low participation can guide outreach efforts to boost voter engagement. This exercise uses various visualization techniques to explore voter turnout patterns and identify potential variables for predictive analysis.

## prediction 
Prediction is a key aspect of spatial data science. It can be used to forecast future values (e.g., predicting air quality for a specific location), downscale information (e.g., using county-level voter turnout data to predict turnout at the census tract level), or fill in missing dataset values.

Scenario: Develop models to predict voter turnout using explanatory variables like income and age. These models will help predict the dependent variable, voter turnout.

## Suitability modeling 
Goal: Select a location for a corporate headquarters that minimizes the carbon footprint. This location should be attractive to prospective employees.

Based on discussions with corporate leaders and subject-matter experts (SMEs), the following criteria were identified and organized into four objectives to clarify their relationships:

Building Site: A location that reduces construction costs and is easily accessible for employees.
Energy Independence: An optimal location for incorporating renewable energy devices.
Access to Amenities: A location that is accessible to various amenities.
Environmental Concerns: A location that minimally disrupts critical environmental areas and corridors.

## Detect patterns

Statistical cluster analysis can help minimize subjectivity in maps by identifying meaningful clusters in data. The Hot Spot Analysis and Outlier Analysis tools use statistics to detect spatial patterns.

## Data patterns using space-time pattern mining

Space-time pattern mining tools use statistics to incorporate spatial and temporal aspects of data, helping to understand spatiotemporal trends.

## Object Detection

### Scenario
Tax assessors at local government agencies often rely on surveys to estimate property values and calculate property taxes. These surveys are infrequent, leading to potential inaccuracies in assessment records. Swimming pools significantly impact property values and are a crucial part of these assessments.

Using ArcGIS deep learning tools, you can detect all swimming pools in a defined area.

## Story Maps

The pattern detection analysis examined Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation rates in the contiguous United States for 2019. This analysis included hot spot and outlier analyses to identify meaningful patterns of high and low SNAP participation. Additionally, the space-time pattern mining analysis examined SNAP participation from 2010 to 2019, revealing how participation rates changed over time.
