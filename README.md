# Spatial Data Science
## visualization 
Data visualization helps you digest information by using symbols to visually represent quantities and categories. quickly make comparisons and perceive relative proportions, patterns, relationships, and trends. Data visualization is important throughout the analysis process, from exploring your data, to interpreting results, to communicating findings. Various data visualization techniques are available in ArcGIS.
Scenario
Because voting is voluntary in the United States, the level of voter participation (referred to as "voter turnout") has a significant impact on the election results and resulting public policy.

Modeling voter turnout, and understanding where low turnout is prevalent, can inform outreach efforts to increase voter participation. In this exercise, various visualization techniques to explore relationships and patterns of voter turnout and to identify potential variables to use in your predictive analysis.

## prediction 
Prediction is an important part of spatial data science. You can use prediction to forecast future values (for example, predicting tomorrow's air quality for a specified location), downscale information (for example, using voter turnout data at the county level to predict voter turnout at the census tract level), or fill in missing values in a dataset.

Scenario

Create models that predict voter turnout. These models will use explanatory variables, such as income and age, to predict the dependent variable, which is voter turnout.

You will use this model to downscale voter turnout from the county level to the census tract level. This information will be used to organize a "Get Out the Vote" canvassing campaign. These campaigns encourage people to vote on Election Day. This model will help identify local regions that are expected to have low voter turnout so that you know where to target your campaign.

## Suitability modeling 
Goal: Choose a location for a corporate headquarters that has a minimal carbon footprint. This location should be situated and designed in a way that is attractive to prospective employees.

Based on the goal for this suitability model, and a discussion with corporate leaders and subject-matter experts (SMEs), the criteria were identified. These criteria have been organized into four objectives to clarify how the criteria relate to each other.

Building site: A location that reduces construction cost and is easily accessible by employees
Energy independence: An optimal location to incorporate renewable energy devices
Access to amenities: A location that is accessible to various amenities
Environmental concerns: A location that will minimally disrupt critical environmental areas and corridors

## Detect patterns

Statistical cluster analysis can help you minimize the subjectivity in your maps by identifying meaningful clusters in your data. The Hot Spot Analysis and Outlier Analysis tools use statistics to detect spatial patterns in your data
